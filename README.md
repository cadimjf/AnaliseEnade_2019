This  work  aims  to  determine  what  are  the  most  influential  socioeconomic  aspects  on  the  Information  Systems students’ performance. 
To achieve it, we used the 2017 National Exam of Students Performance (Enade) data, in order to analyze the student’s grade at the exam and the answers to the socioeconomic questionnaire.  The survey of the  most  impactful  variables  was  implemented  by  the  decision  tree  algorithm  and  the  statistical  correlation coefficient. Then, the selected variables for Information Systems students were widely presented, compared to other courses  attending  to  Enade  2017  and  discussed  in  the  light  of  literature.  We  proved  that,  as  expected,  the  most relevant aspect were family income, exchange and academic scholarship attendance, type of tuition financing and school  administrative  type.  In  the  other  hand,  some  aspects  did  not  influence  the  grade  of  Information  Systems students, 
although  they  are  reported  in  the  literature,  such  as  course  modality  and  working  and  studying simultaneously
